# 🎉 SANDY SNIPER BOT - SYSTEM FIXED & READY

## ✅ **PROBLEMS RESOLVED**

### **🔧 What Was Wrong:**
1. **Codespace Restoration Issue** - When the Codespace was recreated, it restored 50+ old duplicate files
2. **Missing Dependencies** - Virtual environment packages weren't installed  
3. **Import Errors** - Python modules like pytz, sklearn were missing
4. **Workspace Clutter** - Excessive duplicate files causing confusion

✅ kiteconnect>=5.0  
✅ pandas>=2.3
✅ numpy>=2.3
✅ scikit-learn>=1.7

```

#### **2. File Cleanup**

  - `utils/ml_optimizer.py` (ML engine)
  - `system_test.py` (validation script)
  - Core documentation and configs

#### **3. System Validation**
```bash
